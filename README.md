Here are the steps taken for the final design:

1. **Foundational Research**  
   Conducted initial research to understand the target audience and market trends.

2. **Interview**  
   Interviewed potential users and stakeholders to understand their needs.

3. **Survey**  
   Conducted a survey to gather quantitative data on reading habits.

4. **Field Studies**  
   Observed user behaviors in real-world scenarios to identify pain points and opportunities.

5. **Focus Group**  
   Gathered a group of target users to discuss ideas and receive feedback.

6. **Diary Studies**  
   Collected insights from users' daily experiences with reading apps.

7. **Create an Empathy Map for Each Person**  
   Built empathy maps to better understand user needs and emotions.

8. **Create a User Persona**  
   Defined key personas representing the target users.

9. **Create a User Story**  
   Developed user stories to outline the key interactions with the app.

10. **Create a User Journey Map**  
    Mapped out the journey each user takes within the app.

11. **Definition of Problem Statement**  
    Clearly defined the problem the app is solving: "How can we make reading more accessible and enjoyable for people?"

12. **Competitor Audit**  
    Analyzed competing apps and identified areas for improvement.

13. **Ideation**  
    Brainstormed a range of ideas and concepts for the application.

14. **Create Some Sketches**  
    Created rough sketches of app screens and features.

15. **Definition of Goal Statements**  
    Defined specific goals for the design, such as enhancing user engagement with books.

16. **Draw a User Flow Diagram**  
    Mapped the user flow to ensure seamless navigation.

17. **Create Big Pictures**  
    Designed the high-level wireframes for key app screens.

18. **Design Wireframe Pages**
